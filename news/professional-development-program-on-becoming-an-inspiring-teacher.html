              Art of Writing, the Ethics of Teaching, Publishing in High-Impact
              Journals, and Team-Building. Participants gained practical
              insights, from innovative teaching techniques like flipped
              classrooms and case study methods to the importance of maintaining
              ethical teaching practices and effectively utilizing technology in
              education.

            <h3>Opening Valedictory: 9.30 AM to 10.30 AM</h3>
            <p>
              In the opening valedictory session, Dean Dr. Ananth Padmanabhan, a
              distinguished figure in the field of education, warmly introduced
              our esteemed speakers. His gracious welcome set the tone for an
              engaging and insightful session.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prof. Dr. Sreejith, in his enthusiastic and inspiring speech,
              shared his insights on becoming an inspiring teacher. He drew
              inspiration from both real-life and fictional mentors, such as the
              legendary Rick Brathwite and the wise Koboyashi Master. Prof. Dr.
              Sreejith emphasized the significance of role models in shaping
              one’s teaching philosophy and encouraged educators to aspire to be
              the kind of teacher who leaves a lasting positive impact on their
              students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prof. Dr. B.S. Chimni, in his rousing address, delved into the
              concept of leading a “life of the mind” as a crucial aspect of
              being an effective educator. He underscored the importance of
              engaging in intellectual discussions and cultivating a deep
              understanding of ideas beyond the confines of a traditional
              teaching role. Prof. Dr. Chimni also highlighted the relevance of
              the pedagogy of the oppressed, especially during times of crisis,
              as a means of empowering learners. He stressed the need for
              synergy between teaching and research activities, as well as a
              modern teacher’s proficiency in utilizing technology to enhance
              the learning experience. Furthermore, he advocated for an
              environment of benign neglect regarding dissenting and radical
              opinions within educational institutions to foster a fruitful and
              diverse learning environment. Prof. Dr. B.S. Chimni’s talk
              inspired attendees to not only be educators but also intellectual
              leaders in their fields, promoting an enriching educational
              journey for their students.

              Technical Session I (10.30AM to 11.30AM) : The Craft of Pedagogy
            </h3>
            <p>
              During the session on the Craft of Pedagogy led by Prof. Dr.
              Tanushree Sharma, participants delved deeper into innovative
              teaching techniques. The concept of flipped classrooms, for
              instance, was explored in detail, highlighting how it empowers
              students to take ownership of their learning by engaging with
              course materials before class. Case study methods were discussed
              as a powerful tool for contextual learning, allowing students to
              apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
              Activity-based learning, an interactive approach that encourages
              hands-on experiences, was demonstrated, illustrating its
              effectiveness in promoting critical thinking and problem-solving
              skills. Scaffolding, a strategy for breaking down complex topics
              into manageable chunks, was introduced as a means to support
              students’ gradual skill development. The jigsaw method, a
              cooperative learning technique, was also explained, showing how it
              promotes collaboration and shared expertise. Furthermore, the
              session provided a comprehensive breakdown of Bloom’s Taxonomy,
              helping educators align their teaching objectives with the
              cognitive skills they aim to develop in their students.

              Technical Session II (11.30 AM to 12.45 AM): The Art of Writing
            </h3>
            <p>
              Prof. Deepika Jain’s session on The Art of Writing offered
              participants a holistic approach to academic writing. Beyond
              discussing the mechanics of thesis formulation and the critical
              evaluation of existing academic discourse, the session underscored
              the importance of maintaining a consistent writing practice
              throughout the year. Attendees gained insights into effective time
              management and goal setting to ensure continuous progress. The
              discussion on citation management expanded to include guidance on
              proper citation styles and the importance of avoiding plagiarism.
              Prof. Jain also encouraged participants to infuse their writing
              with a personal touch, emphasizing that maintaining the soul of
              their work can make their contributions to the academic community
              more compelling and memorable.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The session on The Ethics of Teaching, led by Prof. Dr. Mousumi
              Mukherjee, delved into the emotional dimension of teaching. Prof.
              Mukherjee stressed that effective teaching goes beyond the
              dissemination of knowledge; it requires building an emotional
              connection with students. Educators were guided on how to achieve
              this connection by being empathetic, approachable, and
              compassionate. Vulnerability was highlighted as a strength,
              allowing teachers to relate to their students on a human level and
              create an atmosphere of trust and authenticity. Intellectual
              competence and curiosity were presented as vital qualities,
              enabling teachers to instill a passion for learning in their
              students. This session served as a reminder that the ethical
              foundation of teaching lies in fostering an environment where
              students feel valued, respected, and inspired to excel.

              Technical Session IV (4.00 PM to 5.00 PM): Publishing in
              High-Impact Journals
            </h3>
            <p>
              In the session on Publishing in High-Impact Journals, Prof. Arjya
              Majumdar went beyond the basics of selecting journals based on
              citation scores. Participants gained a deeper understanding of the
              publication process, from crafting compelling abstracts and
              selecting appropriate journals to managing the flow of their
              research papers effectively. Prof. Majumdar also shared valuable
              insights on suggesting suitable reviewers for their submissions
              and navigating the peer-review process. In addition to discussing
              the importance of citing sources correctly, the session explored
              the challenges posed by cloned and predatory journals, emphasizing
              the need for rigorous scrutiny. Prof. Majumdar also addressed the
              prevailing “publish or perish” culture in academia and encouraged
              participants to strike a balance between crafting high-quality
              content and ensuring its marketability to reach a broader
              audience.

            <h3>The Team-Building Session (5.00 PM to 5.30 PM)</h3>
            <p>
              The Team-Building Session, led by Prof. Tanushree Sharma, provided
              participants with a practical experience of team dynamics and
              cooperation. Activities such as Charades (Dumb Charades) and
              verbal football not only promoted teamwork but also demonstrated
              how such engaging exercises can be utilized in a classroom setting
              to enhance collaboration among students. The icebreaker sessions
              served as effective tools for building camaraderie among
              participants, showcasing the power of interactive and enjoyable
              activities in fostering a positive learning environment. Overall,
              this session not only delivered key insights into team building
              but also left participants with memorable ideas for promoting
              collaboration in their own classrooms.
