          <p>
            A professional law degree has become increasingly appealing to
            students since India’s liberalization in the early 90s, driven by
            the opening of domestic markets, the rise in global trade, and the
            complexities of the new economic order. This spurred demand for
            smart, articulate, and competent professionals to lead in areas like
            mergers and acquisitions, private equity, venture capital
            investments, offshore tax structures, and complex commercial
            transactions. Consequently, national law schools and five-year
            programs gained prominence as law firms and companies sought to hire
            new graduates with attractive pay packages.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, subsequent economic and socio-political changes have
            necessitated a reevaluation of legal education. The increasing
            presence of technology and automation, the need for reimagining
            dispute resolution, the expansion of a regulatory state, and the
            weakening of strict separation between disciplines require new
            models of legal education. While earlier, new graduates were hired
            for due diligence in law firms, today, AI-powered assistants handle
            such tasks. Yet, there remains a growing need for talent and
            leadership at the middle and top levels due to the increasing
            complexity of the legal and regulatory architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Litigation in courts remains a major career option, but dispute
            management through alternative dispute resolution methods like
            commercial arbitration and mediation is increasingly being sought
            after. To fully leverage this demand, legal education must
            incorporate new skills, including data literacy and a basic
            understanding of business and governance processes. The job market
            is also undergoing structural changes with the rise of the gig
            economy, offering exciting work and rewards for those who manage
            time and network effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            VMLS’ law degree is designed to meet these new challenges by molding
            young minds through a pedagogical process that considers these
            changes and equips them with new skills and professional
            capabilities. At VMLS, we value innovation in legal education,
            placing considerable emphasis on course design that addresses the
            identified skill gaps and experiential learning models that provide
            students with hands-on exposure to the professional world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our faculty comprises a mix of legal scholars and practitioners who
            excel in research and training. We envision the teacher as a
            facilitator guiding students through the learning process. Our
            well-funded teaching support unit is committed to integrating
            cutting-edge teaching methods into our daily classroom experience.
            We also aim to create tie-ups with foreign universities for exchange
            programs and joint research initiatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Effective communication is crucial for a successful legal career.
            VMLS’ Communications and English Language Lab (CELL) provides
            foundational communication skills, including grammar, reading,
            writing, and public speaking. We offer a unique curriculum and
            teaching methods to support learners who may have limited exposure
            to English as a working language.
          </p>
          <h3>Central Themes Shaping Legal Education at VMLS</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Technology Integration</li>
            <li>
              The dominant presence of technology and its impact on legal
              systems and frameworks necessitate a focus on technology and
              technology policy as part of the legal curriculum. From basics to
              advanced concepts, students gain a comprehensive understanding of
              the legal and regulatory frameworks governing technology. Courses
              integrate technology into core subjects like constitutional law,
              criminal law, and contracts, with electives covering areas like
              data protection and regulation of the digital economy. Our
              clinical courses equip students with technology licensing skills
              and an understanding of policy-making.
            </li>
            <li>Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR)</li>
            <li>
              ADR methods are increasingly central to dispute resolution
              strategies. The growth of institutions conducting professional ADR
              has made these methods primary in commercial settings. Courts have
              also adopted innovative ADR strategies, such as commercial courts
              deploying informal strategies before trial. Our curriculum
              captures these skills, preparing students for diverse settings,
              from labor mediation to international commercial arbitration. The
              Global Tamil Law Centre (GTLC) also supports this vision by
              addressing challenges pertaining to access to justice within the
              State of Tamil Nadu.
            </li>
            <li>Regulatory State</li>
            <li>
              The rise of the regulatory state impacts the role of lawyers,
              requiring a reevaluation of core courses like constitutional and
              administrative law. Lawyers now engage extensively with regulatory
              bodies, guiding regulated entities on the applicable laws and
              regulations. A sound understanding of jurisprudence, economic and
              political thought, and behavioral aspects of governance is
              essential to perform this role. VMLS’ curriculum is structured to
              meet these demands.
            </li>
            <li>Internationalization and Comparative Law</li>
            <li>
              Internationalization and comparative law have become integral to
              legal education. Policies are shaped by international pressures,
              and legal principles from across the globe inform domestic law.
              Our curriculum exposes students to fundamental themes and global
              debates, preparing them to navigate both Indian and international
              legal landscapes. The Centre for the Promotion of International
              Law exemplifies our commitment, with initiatives like an e-journal
              focusing on present-day international conflict and guest lectures
              on sustainable growth standing out in this regard.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            VMLS is committed to excellence through inclusivity and shaping a
            pioneering model in Indian legal education. Our faculty and support
            systems nurture the best in each student, promoting collaboration
            and problem-solving. We prepare students to generate maximal impact
            in their careers, fulfilling the promise of a comprehensive and
            forward-thinking legal education. We look forward to support from
            all leaders of the bench and the bar in fulfilling this vision.
